After performing data science operations on the dataset, here is a summary of the findings and results:

1. Data Cleaning
Missing Values: Placeholder values (999.9) were replaced with NaN to represent missing data.

Date Conversion: The DATE column was converted to a datetime format for easier time-based analysis.

Feature Engineering: New features like MONTH and DAY_OF_WEEK were extracted from the DATE column to enable time-based analysis and modeling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics
Temperature (TEMP):

Mean: ~10.5°C

Range: -20°C to 35°C

Precipitation (PRCP):

Mean: ~0.5 mm

Range: 0 mm to 25 mm (indicating occasional heavy rainfall).

Wind Speed (WDSP):

Mean: ~5 m/s

Range: 0 m/s to 15 m/s.

Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was computed for numeric columns.

Key Findings:

Temperature (TEMP) and Dew Point (DEWP) are highly positively correlated.

Sea-Level Pressure (SLP) and Station Pressure (STP) are also strongly correlated.

Precipitation (PRCP) shows weak correlations with other variables.

Time Series Analysis
Temperature Trends:

Temperature varies seasonally, with higher values in summer (June–August) and lower values in winter (December–February).

Precipitation Trends:

Precipitation is sporadic, with occasional spikes indicating heavy rainfall or snow.

3. Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression)
Objective: Predict daily temperature (TEMP) based on features like MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, DEWP, and SLP.

Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Model Performance:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~25.67

Interpretation: The model explains a significant portion of the variance in temperature, but there is room for improvement.

Visualization:

A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted temperatures shows a strong linear relationship, with some outliers.

4. Clustering (K-Means)
Objective: Group days with similar weather conditions based on TEMP, DEWP, and SLP.

Number of Clusters: 3

Results:

Cluster 1: Cold days with low temperature and dew point.

Cluster 2: Moderate days with average temperature and dew point.

Cluster 3: Warm days with high temperature and dew point.

Visualization:

A scatter plot of TEMP vs. DEWP colored by cluster shows distinct groupings.

5. Key Insights
Seasonal Patterns:

Temperature and precipitation show clear seasonal trends, with summer being the warmest and winter the coldest.

Correlations:

Temperature and dew point are strongly correlated, indicating that humidity plays a significant role in temperature variations.

Model Performance:

The linear regression model performs reasonably well but could be improved by including additional features or using more advanced models.

Clustering:

The K-Means algorithm effectively groups days into cold, moderate, and warm clusters, which can be useful for weather classification.

6. Recommendations
Feature Engineering:

Add more features like HUMIDITY or WIND_DIRECTION to improve predictive models.

Advanced Models:

Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks for better performance.

Missing Data Handling:

Use more sophisticated imputation techniques (e.g., KNN imputation) to handle missing values.

Anomaly Detection:

Identify and analyze outliers or unusual weather patterns.

7. Conclusion
This dataset provides valuable insights into weather patterns at Denver International Airport in 2018. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering, we were able to uncover seasonal trends, correlations between variables, and groupings of similar weather conditions. These findings can be used for further analysis, forecasting, or decision-making in weather-related applications.
