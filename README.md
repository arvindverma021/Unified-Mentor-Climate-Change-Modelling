Overview
This dataset contains weather data recorded at Denver International Airport, CO, US, for the year 2018. It includes various meteorological measurements such as temperature, dew point, sea-level pressure, visibility, wind speed, and precipitation. The data is recorded daily and can be used for weather analysis, forecasting, and machine learning tasks.

Dataset Details
Source: The data is likely sourced from a weather station at Denver International Airport.

Time Period: January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018.

Frequency: Daily recordings.

Number of Rows: 365 (one row per day).

Number of Columns: 28 (including date, location, and various weather measurements).



Explanation of Each Step ----
Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Load the Dataset: Load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.

Data Cleaning: Replace placeholder values (999.9) with NaN and convert the DATE column to datetime format.

Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize the correlation matrix for numeric columns.

Time Series Analysis: Plot temperature and precipitation over time to observe trends.

Feature Engineering: Extract new features like MONTH and DAY_OF_WEEK from the DATE column.

Predictive Modeling: Train a linear regression model to predict temperature and evaluate its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Clustering: Use K-Means clustering to group similar weather days based on temperature, dew point, and sea-level pressure.

Save the Dataset: Optionally save the updated dataset with cluster labels to a new CSV file.

Expected Outputs
Correlation Matrix: A heatmap showing correlations between numeric variables.

Time Series Plot: A line plot showing temperature and precipitation trends over time.

Linear Regression MSE: The Mean Squared Error of the linear regression model.

Clustering Scatter Plot: A scatter plot showing clusters of weather data based on temperature and dew point.
